# Open Duck Mini Stand

This is an OpenSCAD-based design for the Open Duck Mini stand.

## Overview

This stand is designed for the Open Duck Mini and consists of four main components that can be 3D printed separately and assembled together.

## Components

The stand is made up of the following parts:

### 1. Frame
The main structural frame of the stand, print 2x.

**STL File:** [frame.stl](frame.stl)

### 2. Top Plate
The top surface where the keyboard sits.

**STL File:** [top.stl](top.stl)

### 3. Mid Brace
A support brace that provides additional structural stability.

**STL File:** [mid_brace.stl](mid_brace.stl)

### 4. Foot Rest
The foot rest components (two are needed, one for each side).

**STL File:** [foot_rest.stl](foot_rest.stl)

## Source Files

The OpenSCAD source file is available as `stand.scad`. You can modify the design parameters in this file and regenerate the STL files as needed.

## Assembly

The components are designed to be assembled using M3 screws. Use PLA or ABS to print do *NOT* use PETG, the needed brass inserts will not work in PETG as its molecularly slippery and the brass inserts will rotate in place. Use M3 brass inserts in the mid_brace and the frame.
