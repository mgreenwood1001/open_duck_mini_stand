## Overview

This stand is designed for the Open Duck Mini and consists of four main components that can be 3D printed separately and assembled together.

## Components

The stand is made up of the following parts:

### 1. Frame
The main structural frame of the stand, print 2x.

**STL File:** [frame.stl](stl/frame.stl)

### 2. Top Plate
The top surface where the keyboard sits.

**STL File:** [top.stl](stl/top.stl)

### 3. Mid Brace
A support brace that provides additional structural stability.

**STL File:** [mid_brace.stl](stl/mid_brace.stl)

### 4. Foot Rest
The foot rest components (two are needed, one for each side).

**STL File:** [foot_rest.stl](stl/foot_rest.stl)

## Source Files

The OpenSCAD source file is available as `stand.scad`. You can modify the design parameters in this file and regenerate the STL files as needed.

## Assembly

The components are designed to be assembled using M3 screws. Use PLA or ABS to print do *NOT* use PETG, the needed brass inserts will not work in PETG as its molecularly slippery and the brass inserts will rotate in place. Use M3 brass inserts in the mid_brace and the frame.

## License

This design is provided as-is (and by "as-is," I mean exactly as it is, with all its quirks, potential flaws, and the distinct possibility that I made a measurement error at 2 AM). There are no warranties here—not expressed, not implied, not even the kind you'd get from a vending machine that's clearly broken but still takes your money.

I am not responsible for what you do with this digital data. If you print this and it collapses under the weight of your keyboard, that's on you. If you modify it and it somehow becomes sentient and starts judging your typing speed, that's also on you. If you distribute it and someone uses it in a way that causes damage, injury, or loss—you guessed it, that's on you too. 

You are an adult (presumably), and you assume all responsibility and liability for your use of these files and any products you create from them. I'm just a person who couldn't find the version everyone else was using, so I made my own. That's the extent of my involvement here. Now go forth and print responsibly and don't use PETG.
